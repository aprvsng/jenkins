### Jenkins is a widely used open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes.  
### Jenkins automates the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository.  
### It ensures that the codebase is regularly built, tested, and integrated, reducing the chances of integration issues.  
### Jenkins supports continuous delivery by automating the deployment process, making it easier to release software updates.
